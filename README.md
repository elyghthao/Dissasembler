# Dissasembler
Converts a memory image of instructions and data back to 68000 assembly langauge and output the disassembled code to display. 

Disassembler asks for starting location and ending location in hexadecimal format. Dissasembler scans memory region and outputs the memory addresses of the instructions and the assembly language instructions contained in that region to display. Reads each memory address, and goes through an algorithmic sequence to decipher correct opcode and affected memory locations.
